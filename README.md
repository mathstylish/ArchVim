## Installation
### Linux
Clone my repo to your machine
```bash

```
Backup your current neovim configuration (if exists)
```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.old
```
Move the new neovim configuration
```bash
mv clone-path/nvim ~/.config
```
### Windows
Currently i'm on GNU/Linux using Arch Linux, so i can't ensure that this setup will fully run on Windows. But don't worry, i'll working on it soon.
